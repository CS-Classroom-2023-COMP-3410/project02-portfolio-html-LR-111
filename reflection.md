# Reflection on Portfolio Website Development

During the development of my personal portfolio website, I focused on creating a visually appealing and functional website that showcases my love for snowboarding. One of the challenges I encountered was organizing the content into directories like "about", "projects", and "gallery" while ensuring the site remained easy to navigate. Additionally, I worked on ensuring the site included enough images and content types to meet the requirements.

I also faced some difficulties with uploading the website to the CS Unix account due to issues with pushing my changes to the Git repository. After troubleshooting the push issues by increasing the Git buffer size and checking my credentials, I was able to resolve the problem and successfully upload the website.

Overall, the development process was rewarding, and I learned how to manage content organization and deal with technical issues in a real-world scenario.
